# Austin Crime Analytics

This was an extra credit project for my CS 3753 Data Science class. It focuses on opening a CSV file that was found on [this website](https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/2016-Annual-Crime-Data/8iue-zpf6) which contains entries for every crime commited in the city of Austin, Texas. The project itself was meant to examine information to draw conclusions based on the data, and apply our tools we learned throughout the semester. While coming up with the plan for my project, I hypothesized that clustering and mapping the crime locations would offer up the most interesting data. After taking a look at the results, I personally find clustering to be the most helpful.

## Goals:

The goal of the project itself was purely to explore a data set to draw conclusions or correlations and then report on our findings. I took the exploritory approach, not having a particular theory I was trying to prove, but just to see what information might rise to the top. After happening upon the Austin data set, I recalled that I have not frequented Austin as much as I'd like to, and knowing more about it couldn't hurt. I realized that mapping the crimes themselves would prove to be the most beneficial, as we can see the cities hot zones or high frequency areas.

## The Program itself:

Python was the chosen language of the course, solely for it's powerful libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. It makes it easy to visualize the data and distplay it in many different ways without having to bend over backwards. While working on the project, I made it a point to seperate the logic into clearly defined objectives so that you can read through the results with more ease. Firstly,
