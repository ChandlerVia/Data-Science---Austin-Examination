# Austin Crime Analytics
This was an extra credit project for my CS 3753 Data Science class. It focuses on opening a CSV file that was found on https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/2016-Annual-Crime-Data/8iue-zpf6 which contains entries for every crime commited in the city of Austin, Texas. The project itself was meant to examine information to draw conclusions based on the data, and apply our tools we learned throughout the semester. While coming up with the plan for my project, I hypothesized that clustering and mapping the crime locations would offer up the most interesting data. After taking a look at the results, I personally find clustering to be the most helpful.
